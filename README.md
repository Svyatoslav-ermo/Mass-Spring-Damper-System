# Mass-Spring-Damper-System
The code calculates the reactionary motion of the mass in a spring-damper system over time. The program also creates 1 second 30 fps video animation of the mass oscillations. The code generates two Bode plots: absolute gain vs. normalized frequency &amp; phase shift vs. normalized frequency.
