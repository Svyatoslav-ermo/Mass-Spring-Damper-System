# Mass-Spring-Damper-System
The code calculates the reactionary motion of the mass in a spring-damper system over time. The program also creates 1 second 30 fps video animation of the mass oscillations. The code generates two Bode plots: absolute gain vs. normalized frequency &amp; phase shift vs. normalized frequency.

Model and Methods:
-------------
The script takes the mass, damping ratio, spring constant, and driving force to calculate the reactionary motion of the mass over time. The code will simulate 8 different trials, 5 of which will have specific parameters set while the other 3 will be designed to have parameters that generate an over-damped, critically damped, and under-damped vibrations. For each trial, the code will employ 1st, 2nd, and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods to solve for homogeneous and inhomogeneous responses, using 2nd order differential equation that governs the motion. The code will plot position vs. time for homogeneous and inhomogeneous responses for each Runge-Kutta method of each trial. The code will use results of 4th order Runge-Kutta to generate the frequency response bode plots: absolute gain vs. normalized frequency and phase shift vs. normalized frequency. The code will generate 3 videos 10 seconds long with 30 frames per second to demonstrate over-damped, critically-damped, and under-damped systems.

Discussion:
------------
The results from the script demonstrate the differences in estimation between first, second, and fourth order Runge-Kutta methods. The Bode plots show the role that the damping ratio of each system plays on the absolute gain and phase shift. The real-time animations visualize differences between the behaviors of over damped, critically damped, and under damped systems.
In the first trial, it can be seen that the first order Runge-Kutta method significantly differs from the second and fourth order methods. Particularly, it significantly overestimates the position of the mass towards the final 10 seconds of the simulation. The amplitude gets over 1000 m (1 km), which is unrealistic. On the other hand, the second and fourth order Runge-Kutta methods do not demonstrate noticeable differences in estimations between each other as can be seen in all trials. The error for second and fourth methods is small enough to not notice differences by looking at the plots. Comparing the first order with other methods, the plots do not differ in trials #2, #3, #4, #6, and #7. The other figures demonstrate deviation of the first order method from the other two and its overestimation of the amplitude. These trials that demonstrate difference in the first order method are all for under-damped cases (ùúâ<1). Presumably, on each iteration of the Runge-Kutta, the first-order method overestimates the position, which leads to a higher restoration force of the spring, which leads to even more overestimation.

As can be seen in trials #6 and #7, the inhomogeneous plots demonstrate the further change in position caused by the forcing function. As the mass gets farther from the equilibrium, the change in position decreases, as the pulling force of the spring compensates the pulling force of the forcing function. Additionally, the forcing function is a sinusoidal function of time and increases and decreases as the time progresses. The critically damped case in trial #7 shows smaller change in position than in figure #6, regardless of ùëé0 being larger for trial #7 than for trial #6. The forcing function pulls stronger in trial #7 than in #6 yet results in smaller change in position. Possibly because the critically damped system in trial #7 pulls the mass stronger than over-critically damped system in trial #6. Trial #8 also has greater ùëé0 for the forcing function, however, it does not demonstrate significant change in position compared to the homogeneous case. Other trials #1-5 show small change in position for inhomogeneous cases compared with homogeneous, but due to ùëé0 being smaller than in trials #6-8, the change is barely noticeable.
As can be seen in absolute gain vs. normalized frequency Bode plot, the absolute gain is the largest for under-damped cases. The damping ratio (ùúâ) is less than 1 for three curves of under-damped cases (trial #1, #8, and #5). The absolute gain for these trials is the largest when the frequency of interest œâ is the same as the natural frequency ùúîùëõ. The other curves for critically damped and over-damped cases demonstrate the decrease in the absolute gain as normalized frequency gets larger. Critically damped cases have larger absolute gain than over-damped cases. The following correlation can be derived from the plot: The average absolute gain decreases as the damping ratio gets larger.
As can be seen in phase shift vs. normalized frequency, the phase shift for under-damped cases changes slowly until œâ gets closer to ùúîùëõ. Then the phase shifts abruptly from around 0 to -90 and then from +90 back to near 0. Critically and over-damped cases demonstrate more gradual change in phase shift. The curves demonstrate that the phase shift change is slower and gets more linear for larger damping ratios.
The damping ratio is called over-critically damped when its absolute gain is smaller compared to critically and under-damped ratios. This means that the system is damped too much that there is less gain, and the phase shift change occurs slower. As can be seen from the trials 1-8, the over-damped systems return slower to equilibrium than critically and under-damped systems. Critically damped ratio has more gain than over-damped cases and the phase shift change occurs faster. It returns to equilibrium faster than over-damped cases. It is called critically damped ratio because it is the most critical and fastest return to equilibrium that does not lead to any further oscillations from the equilibrium. Under-damped ratio produces the larger absolute gain than the other two types of ratios, the phase shift changes abruptly. It is called under-damped because the system does not possess enough damping to prevent wobbling. The return to equilibrium is the fastest, but it overshoots the equilibrium and leads to further oscillations with overshooting for some time until the system finally loses its energy and reaches equilibrium.
